Using Multiple Configs
======================

`View on GitHub <https://github.com/GDWR/classy-config/tree/main/examples/multiple_configs>`_

There maybe a time were having multiple config files would allow for cleaner deployment,
readability and/or maintainability.

To accommodate this, ``ClassyConfig`` allows you to prefix your config files to allow them to be
used alongside each other.

So for this example, we have the following two configuration files.

``config.toml``

.. code-block:: toml

    app_name="Example App"


``database.toml``

.. code-block:: toml

    host="127.0.0.1"
    port=5432


This is how they could be loaded, to run alongside each other.

.. code-block:: python

    from classy_config import register_config, ConfigValue

    register_config(filepath="config.toml")  # This will allow gathering of all values, as usual
    register_config(filepath="database.toml", prefix="database")  # This will allow gathering of all values, with the prefix 'database'

    app_name = ConfigValue("app_name", str)
    print(f"Starting application: {app_name}")

    database_host = ConfigValue("db.host", str)
    database_port = ConfigValue("db.port", int)
    print(f"Connecting to database: {database_host}:{database_port}")
